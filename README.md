# ts-10-design-patterns-2

This project contains an example of sorting implementation with a generic approach.

- 01.sorter/BadSorter.ts contains a not reusable approach, which requires changes to the code itself.
- 01.sorter/Sorter.ts contains a more reusable approach through interfaces.
- 02.inheritance/Sorter.ts contains the final approach with inheritance and abstract classes.

Topics:

- interfaces to make code more generic
- class getters (`NumbersCollections.ts`)
- abstract classes to share common functionality through classes that provides a different implementation
